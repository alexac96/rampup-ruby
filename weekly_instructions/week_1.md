## Homework

### Submission:
Email me all of the code that you create as part of the homework.  
Don't worry if it's incorrect, you're not being graded, this is purely about your own learning  
Feel free to ask for help and share knowledge from fellow students and from me via slack  
  
If you want more work, let me know

### Basic Homework:

### 1. Arrays
A) `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`  
  - use indexes to get the letter 'd' from the array  
  - uses negative indexes to get the letter 'd'  

### 2. Booleans
A) inequalities: type these into repl.it to see what they output  
  - `10 < 20`  
  - `'hello' != 'hello'`  
  - `(50 / 2) >= 25`  
  
B) operators:  use repl to see what each of these returns  
  - `10 > 5 && 10 < 20`  
  - `10 < 5 && 10 < 20`  
  - `10 > 5 && 10 > 20`  
  - `10 > 5 && 10 < 20`  
  
  - `10 > 5 || 10 < 20`  
  - `10 < 5 || 10 < 20`  
  - `10 > 5 || 10 > 20`  
  - `10 > 5 || 10 < 20`  

### 3. Control flow
Get input from the user:
```ruby
print 'Give me a number: '  # Tell the user to input a number
number = gets.chomp  # Set their input to the variable "number".  Chomp cuts off the newline
```
  
A) Write a program that takes a number  
  - If the number is even then print "This number is even"  
  - If the number is odd print "This number is odd"  
  - If the number is 0, print "This is zero"  
  
HINT: use the modulo operator `%` to determine if odd or even  


### 4. While loop
[Basic Usage](https://github.com/toppy42/rampup-ruby/blob/master/explanations/loop.md#syntax-rules)  

A) Write a while loop that prints something 10 times  

B) Use `gets` to ask the user and print something that number of times  

C) Sum an array  
  - Example: `[2, 4, 10]` should return `16`  

D) Sum only the even numbers in an array  
  - Example: `[2, 5, 8, 17]` should return `10`  

E) Sum numbers greater than 10  
  - Example: `[5, 100, 9, 4]` should return `18`  
  
  
### 5. Complex control flow
A) Convert [this flow chart](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.32643010.3931/flat,550x550,075,f.jpg) into a program  
  - Ask the user a yes/no question at each decision point to navigate the flow  

B) Write a program that asks for a users age and the state they live in and tells them what rights they have  
**NOTE: If you don't want to write out every state, just choose a couple and give an error for the rest**  
  - Drinking  
  - Smoking  
  - Driving  
  - Gambling  
  - Sexual consent  
  - Marijuana  


### 6. Read this code
Read the following code. Make sure you understand every piece.  Play with it in Repl.it.  Google search for anything you don't know.  If there's something you don't understand and can't find on google message me in slack and make a note of it so that we can discuss it in class  

**NOTE:** All of these functions can take strings or arrays  

A) Use the [precedence table](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Operator_Precedence) to manually evaluate the code below  
B) Write a summary of what each function does  
C) Explain in your own words how the function works  

**Reading 1:**  
```ruby
# Takes a string
given_string = "This is the test string"
i = 0
output = ''

while i < given_string.length
  output += given_string[i * -1 - 1]
  i += 1
end

output
```
**HINTS: Strings have indexes like arrays.  Both have negative indexes**  
  
  
**Reading 2:**  
Set the variable `given` to different things to see what this code does  
  - Set `given = 'racecar'`  
  - Set `given = 'test'`  
  - Set `given = [2, 1, 2]`  
  - Set `given = [1, 2, 3]`  

```ruby
# Can take a string or array
given = # set this equal to something
answer = true

while given.length >  1 && answer == true
  if given[0] == given[-1]
    given = given[1..-2]
  else
    answer = false
  end
end  

answer
```
