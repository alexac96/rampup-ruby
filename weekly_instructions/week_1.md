3) Abstract with Variables  
[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/A_3.rb)  

### Exercise B: Precedence  
1) Find the error in this code by evaluating the code like a computer  

What does this return?  What should it return?
Find the error using the [Precedence table](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Operator_Precedence)  

Required Topics:  
- Precedence  

Starting code:  
```
['bread', 'peanut butter'][0] == 'bread' ||
['bread', 'peanut butter'][1] == 'bread' &&
['bread', 'peanut butter'][0] == 'jelly' ||
['bread', 'peanut butter'][1] == 'jelly'  
```
[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/B_1.md)  

## Exercise C: Control Flow  
1) Write an if statement
  - if we have the right ingredients in our inventory, print out "You can make a PBJ!"  
  - if we do not have the right ingredients, print out "Go to the store"  

[Starting Code](/weekly_exercises/week_1/C_0.rb)  

Required Topics:  
- Control Flow  
- `puts` (Strings)  

[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/C_1.rb)  

2) Test your code  
  - Change your inventory to not have the right ingredients.  Does it print the right sentence?  
  - Change your inventory to have the right ingredients.  Does it print the right sentence?  


## Exercise D: While Loop  
[Starting State](/weekly_exercises/week_1/D_0.rb)  

1) Change your code to use while loops  
Required Topics:  
- While Loops  

[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/D_1.rb)  

2) Change your code to allow any length of inventory  
Required Topics:

[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/D_2.rb)  

## Exercise E: Functions
1) Write a function that takes an inventory array as an argument and tells us if there is peanut butter in it  
[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/E_1.rb)  

2) Write a general function that takes an inventory and an item and checks if the item is in the inventory  
[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/E_2.rb)  

3) Use the general function to clean up the code from exercise D  
[Answer](/weekly_exercises/week_1/E_3.rb)  


## Homework

### Submission:
Email me all of the code that you create as part of the homework.  
Don't worry if it's incorrect, you're not being graded, this is purely about your own learning  
Feel free to ask for help and share knowledge from fellow students and from me via slack  
  
If you want more work, let me know

### 1. Sum Array
Go to https://repl.it/EhIS/2

1.1 ) Sum all numbers in array
Using what you learned in class, write a function that takes an array of numbers returns the sum
When you run it, all 3 tests should print out "Great Job!"

1.2) Only sum odd numbers
1.3) Only sum numbers > 10

  
  
### 2. Read this code
Read the following code. Make sure you understand every piece.  Play with it in Repl.it.  Google search for anything you don't know.  If there's something you don't understand and can't find on google message me in slack and make a note of it so that we can discuss it in class


**NOTE:** All of these functions can take strings or arrays  

1) Use the [precedence table](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Operator_Precedence) to manually evaluate the code below
2) Write a summary of what each function does  
3) Explain in your own words how the function works

**Reading 1:**
```
# Can take a string or array
def some_function(given_string)
  i = 0
  output = ''

  while i < given_string.length
    output += given_string[i * -1 - 1]
    i += 1
  end

  return output
end
```
**HINTS: Strings have indexes like arrays.  Both have negative indexes**


**Reading 2:**
```
# Can take a string or array
def some_func_2(given_string)
  if given_string.length <= 1
  	return true
  else
  	if given_string[0] == given_string[-1]
  		return some_func_2(given_string[1..-1])
  	else
  		return false
  	end
  end
end
```

**Reading 3:**
```
# Can take a string or array
def some_func_3(given_string)
	answer = true

	while given_string.length >	1 && answer == true
		if given_string[0] == given_string[-1]
			given_string = given_string[1..-2]
		else
			answer = false
		end
	end	
	
	return answer
end
```

### 3. Learn something new
Replace the while loop below with a for loop  
Notes:
- You will have to google for how to use a for loop
- You will have to change how the answer is created and changed

```
# Can take a string or array
def some_func_3(given_string)
  answer = true

  while given_string.length > 1 && answer == true
    if given_string[0] == given_string[-1]
      given_string = given_string[1..-2]
    else
      answer = false
    end
  end  
  
  return answer
end
```


### 4. Extra credit
Same as exercise 3, but use an iterator instead of a loop
Hints:
- You don't know what an iterator is.  Google it
- The most common ones are `each` and `map`
