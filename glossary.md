# Main Glossary


## Concepts
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstraction | | Making code easier to write by making it less literal |
| Algorithm | | Instructions for how to accomplish something |
| Object | | If code were a sentance, objects would be the nouns. Any "thing" (Array, Number, Boolean)  |
| [Precedence](/explanations/precedence.md) | | The order that computer reads code |
| Recursion |  | Repeating a process with a smaller problem |
| [State](/explanations/state.md) | | The current attributes.  The state of the world |

## Data types
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Array](/explanations/array.md) | `[ 42, 'text' ]` | A list that starts at 0. Access data with indexes |
| [Boolean](/explanations/boolean.md) | `true` , `false` | How the computer represents true and false |
| [Number](/explanations/number.md) | `1`   `2.2` | Same as numbers in math |
| [String](/explanations/string.md) | `'this is some text'`, `"this is more text"` | Used to store text.  Single and double quotes |
| [Hash](/explanations/hash.md) | `{ 'age' => '175', 'name' => 'Farnsworth' }` | A storage of key value pairs |
| [Symbol](/explanations/symbol.md)| `:age` | names |
| [Nil](/explanations/nil.md)| `nil` | represents nothingness |

## Tools
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Boolean Comparison](/explanations/boolean.md#boolean-comparisons) | `1 == 1` returns `true`, `'text'==2` returns `false` |  Equalities and inequalities |
| [Boolean Operator](/explanations/boolean.md#boolean-operators) | AND: `1==1 && 2==2` returns `true` OR: `1==1 || 'text'==2` returns `true` | Combines boolean comparisons |
| [Control Flow](/explanations/control_flow.md) | `puts 'equal' if 1==1` | How to teach the computer to make decisions |
| [JSON](/explanations/json.md) | `'{"youtube": [{"video1": "cats"}]}'` | Data format used all over the web |

## Tools for abstraction
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Variable](/explanations/variable.md) | `my_age = 27` | saving an object by giving it a name |
| [While Loop](/explanations/loop.md#while-loop) | `while _condition_` | Repeat a set of instructions until condition is false |
| [Function](/explanations/function.md) | DEFINE: `def my_function; end;` USE: `my_function` | If code were a sentance, functions would be the Verbs |
| [Function Argument](/explanations/function.md#parametersarguments) | DEFINE: `def my_function(argument_1, argument_2)`, USE: `my_function(1, 2)` | The objects we give to a function |
| [Method](/explanations/function.md) | `[1,2,3].length` returns `3`  | Functions called on objects |
| [For Loop](/explanations/for_loop.md) | `for number in [1,2,3,4]` | Repeat some operation for each item in an array or hash |
