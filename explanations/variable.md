#Variables

## What's a Variable?
When we want to reference something in many different places in our code, we need to name it.  The name is the variable

## Glossary
| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| assignment | the act of setting a variable |


## Syntax rules
Can use any numbers or letters, but not punctuation

variables with multiple-part names are separated by underscores

`this_is_a_long_variable_name`


## Assigning
`my_variable = 123`

`my_name = 'Ethan'`

`my_age = 27`


## Referencing (using)

`puts my_name` => will print `Ethan` to the console

`my_age + 100` => returns `127`




## Common problems
### Scoping
Variables are only available in the area that you defined them

```
# Defined in the "Global" scope
# The global scope (everything outside of the functions) can access:
#  external_var
#
# but cannot access:
#  internal_var_1, internal_var_2
external_var = 123


# example_function_1 can access:
#  internal_var_1
# but cannot access:
#  external_var, internal_var_2

def example_function_1
  internal_var_1 = 456
end


# example_function_2 can access:
#  internal_var_2
#
# but cannot access:
#  external_var, internal_var_1

def example_function_2
  internal_var_2 = 789
end

```


### Variable unassigned
If you have not yet assigned a variable, or you do not have access to it, you will get this error:

`NameError: undefined local variable or method 'my_var' for main:Object`


## Changing a variable
If you want to change it to something entirely different, just set it to something new
```
my_var = 123
puts my_var # returns 123

my_var = 456
puts my_var # returns 456
```

If you want to edit the value, you can reference the variable in the assignment
```
my_var = 100
my_var = my_var - 1  # Now it's equal to 99

my_var += 50  # Now it's equal to 149
```
